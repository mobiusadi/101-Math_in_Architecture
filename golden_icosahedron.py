System: It looks like the response was cut off, likely due to a processing limit or an error in generating the complete script. I’ll pick up where it left off, completing the Manim script for the golden ratio animation that transitions into displaying a golden-colored icosahedron. The script will build on the previous golden ratio animation, adding the icosahedron to emphasize its connection to the golden ratio and setting the stage for your next exploration of the sunflower spiral. I’ll also address your architectural context and provide guidance for when you try this later, ensuring compatibility with VS Code (locally or in GitHub Codespaces).

### Step 3: Completing the Manim Script
The script below continues from the golden ratio animation, adding the icosahedron in a golden color and a text annotation to connect it to nature. It starts with the line, forms the L-shape, creates the golden rectangle, and then embeds a 3D icosahedron. Since you’re excited to try this later, I’ll ensure the script is standalone and clear.
